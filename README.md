# Data-Engineering-Project

This project implements an end-to-end data engineering pipeline for analyzing the sentiment of news titles. The pipeline is built using Azure Data Services and demonstrates key concepts of data ingestion, transformation, incremental loading, and visualization.

The goal is to identify positive vs. negative sentiments in news titles and analyze their distribution across time (e.g., weekdays) using Power BI dashboards.
